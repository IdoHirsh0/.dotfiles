# .dotfiles
All my .dotfiles in one place ðŸ˜€

Easily set up a development environment on a fresh machine!

## Installation steps

1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. `cd .dotfiles`
3. Make sure `install.sh` has execution premmisions
    - If not, run `chmod +x install.sh`
4. Run `./install.sh`
5. Open a new terminal session

And that's it ðŸ˜œ

## Additions

### Nvim
- Couldn't find a way to autoinstall language parsers for treesitter in `nvim`
- Inside `nvim` run `:TSInstall <language>` to install a language parser
- To see all supported languages run `:TSInstallInfo`

### Font
- Couldn't find a way to auto setup the `Hack Nerd Font` as the default terminal font
- Change the font manually in the terminal's preferences to enjoy the full experience of the terminal using icons
- To see the added fonts go to `~/.local/share/fonts`

## Small issues

### Packer
- The first time you'll open `nvim`, you'll see some errors
- That's because it's installing `Packer`, the plugin manager, for the first time
- Don't worry, it's only for the first time you open `nvim`
- Close and reopen `nvim` to use your new configured environment ðŸ˜Ž
